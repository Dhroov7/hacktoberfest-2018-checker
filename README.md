# hacktoberfest-2018-checker

It checks your progress through Hacktoberfest 2018!

The project is very simple and great for beginners (experienced people are also welcome, of course. Afterall, there's always room for improvement).

It uses NodeJS and AWS Lambda. In order to mock AWS Lambda's behaviour, I am using the https://serverless.com/ framework.

Feel free to create a PR and help improving this project.
